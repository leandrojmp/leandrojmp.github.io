Hello, my name is Leandro, I have a _BSc_ in Electronics Engineering, but I work as a SysAdmin, more specifically with Infrastructure and Monitoring.

In the last few years I've acquired a growing interest in Data Engineering, all parts of the process of acquiring, treating, transforming and sharing data for posterior analysis and usage, I've been also trying to learn more about development and some programming languages, at this time I'm studying [Python][python] and [Go][golang].

I will be going to use this space to share posts about topics or tools that I've been studying or using, both at work and on personal projects.

You can also find me on  [twitter][twitter], [instagram][instagram] and [github][github].
