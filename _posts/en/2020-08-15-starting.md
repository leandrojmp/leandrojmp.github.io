Since my first contact with the Internet, something around '96, I have always been interested in having a space to talk about anything, from trivial everyday stuff to longer articles on technologies I use, a personal website like so many others.

At that time, the concept of a *blog* was very new and the publishing tools, as we have today, were practically nonexistent. If you wanted to have a website, you needed to learn how to make one from scratch. Because of that, I ended up learning a bit of *HTML* and *CSS* and publishing on existing services, like [Geocities][geocities].

From there on, *blogs* and personal websites have been through popularity cycles, publishing plataforms have emerged and disappeared and even the idea of having your own website became obsolete, being replaced by posts on social networks like [Twitter][twitter], [Facebook][facebook] or [Instagram][instagram]. In all this time, I must have created and deleted dozens of websites. I've come to realize that I am more interested in the building process than in the publishing or keeping up the update frequency.

More recently, I've thought about getting back to having my own space to publish some articles, talking about stuff and tools that I'm studying or using at work and on personal projects, so I decided to build this site. A lot of what I know today I've only been able to learn or understand thanks to other blog posts and personal websites. I think that sharing what I have learned and have been learning is a way to giving back and spreading knowledge.

I've also decided to use [Jekyll][jekyll], a static-site generator, instead of a publishing plataform like [Medium][medium] or [Blogspot][blogspot], so that I can have total control over the articles that I publish and will not be subjected to end user policy changes or publishing paywalls. It is also an opportunity for myself to keep up-to-date with *HTML* and *CSS* when trying to change the website theme, which is something that is in my *backlog*.
