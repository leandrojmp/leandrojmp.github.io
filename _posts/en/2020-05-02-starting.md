Since my first contact with the Internet, something around '96, I was always interested in having a space to talk about anything, from trivial everyday stuff to longer articles on technologies I use, a personal website like so many others.

At that time, the concept of a *blog* was very new and the publishing tools, as we have today, were practically nonexistent, if you wanted to have a website, you needed to learn how to make one from scratch, because of that I ended up learning a bit of *HTML* and *CSS* and publishing on existing services, like [Geocities][geocities].

From there on, *blogs* and personal websites went through popularity cycles, publishing plataforms have emerged and disappeared and even the idea of having your own website became obsolete, being replaced by posts on social networks like [Twitter][twitter], [Facebook][facebook] or [Instagram][instagram]. In all this time, I must have created and deleted a dozen websites, I realized that I was more interested in the building process than in the publishing or keeping up the update frequency.

More recently, I thought about going back with having my own space to publish some articles, talk about stuff and tools that I'm studying or using at work and on personal projects, and so I decided to build this site. Much of what I know today I was only able to learn or understand thanks to others blog posts and personal websites, I think that sharing what I have learned and have been learning is a way to giving back and spreading knowledge.

I also decided to use [Jekyll][jekyll], a static-site generator, instead of a publishing plataform like [Medium][medium] or [Blogspot][blogspot], this way I will have total control over the articles that I publish and will not be subjected to end user policies changes or publishing paywalls, it is also an opportunity to update myself with HTML and CSS when trying to change the website theme, which is something that is in my backlog.
